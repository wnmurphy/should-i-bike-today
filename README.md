Should I Bike Today?
================

This repo contains a single-page, single function application I built in Angular.

The application grabs a user's geolocation from his or her device, and compares it against data from a third-party weather API.

If there is a greater than 10% chance of rain over the next 30 minutes, the user is advised to drive to work instead of biking in.
